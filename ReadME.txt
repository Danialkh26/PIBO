The main.py has the main body of the Phyisics-Informed Bayesian Optimziation alghorithm.
The data queried from the precipitation model are stored as databases that includes input variables, tranformation temperature,
volume fraction, and mean inter-particle distance. 
Note that the database includes results from all 50 replications of simulations.

The precipitation model and Kawin package can be found in:
